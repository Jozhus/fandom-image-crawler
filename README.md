# fandom-image-crawler
Crawls through fandom's category pages and downloads + sorts all profile and gallery images.

Youtube videos in the gallery are ignored. Made to scrape the Maplestory Fandom wikia page, but can be used for any Fandom-based wikia.

I did not bother to do much edgecase or error handling.

# Usage
`py "fandom image crawler.py" LINK`

e.g. `py "fandom image crawler.py" https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/Category:NPCs`
